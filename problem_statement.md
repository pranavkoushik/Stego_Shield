# Problem Statement

## Technical Challenge
The project addresses the critical need for secure data concealment in digital communications through steganographic techniques. Specifically, it tackles the challenge of embedding textual data within digital images while maintaining three key requirements:

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensuring reliable embedding and extraction of text data without corruption
2. **Image Quality Preservation**: Minimizing visual artifacts in carrier images
3. **Security**: Implementing password-based encryption for access control

## Technical Implementation
The solution implements:
1. **LSB (Least Significant Bit) Steganography**:
   - Modifies only the least significant bits of pixel values
   - Uses password-based pseudo-random pixel selection
   - Implements bit-level data manipulation within uint8 constraints

2. **Security Measures**:
   - SHA-256 hashing for password-based pixel selection
   - Non-sequential bit storage pattern
   - Delimiter-based message encoding

3. **User Interface Requirements**:
   - Web-based accessibility
   - Intuitive file upload/download mechanism
   - Real-time feedback and error handling

## Success Criteria
The implementation must achieve:
1. Zero-knowledge principle - carrier images show no visible alterations
2. Reliable message recovery with correct passwords
3. Error handling for invalid inputs or corrupted data
4. Web interface response time under 2 seconds
5. Support for common image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG)

## Impact
This solution enables:
1. Secure communication in environments with content monitoring
2. Digital watermarking for content authentication
3. Privacy-preserving information sharing
4. User-friendly steganographic operations without technical expertise

The project successfully balances security requirements with usability, making steganographic techniques accessible while maintaining robust security measures.
